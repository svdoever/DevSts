DevSts is a minimal version of the depricated EmbeddedSts project that is part of Thinktecture.IdentityModel.
We renamed the project to DevSts because this version is a minimal subset of the original EmbeddedSts project.

Large portions of the code base come from the project https://github.com/IdentityModel/Thinktecture.IdentityModel.
That codebase was forked by Bas Lijten at https://github.com/BasLijten/Thinktecture.IdentityModel. Bas Lijten
extended the ThinkTecture.IdentityModel project to include support for FederationMetadata.xml, so the development
STS could easily be consumed from OWIN.
